I think I have a block list working finally. I initially
had this tricky where I would use memory offsets to calculate
block value and I was going to save some space by packing
2 nodes to a word, but then I realize I lose the elegance
of the packing scheme. So, we're back to each node being
a word, with 16 bits being wasted on empty data (for now),
and the block number being computed as an offset from the
linked list.

@10:24 Sonilo Coding Day. Cache structure? #sonilo #timelog:01:15:41
A cache in sonilo is a structure that makes it easier
to manage blocks from the blockstack.
---
Primarily, a cache represents a set of blocks allocated.
One would be able to allocate a block from the blockstack,
and then add it to the cache.
---
When a cache is cleared, all the blocks in the set get freed
and returned to the blockstack for reuse.
---
Eventually, Sonilo will be composed out of smaller programs
called fragments. Fragments can belong to a context. Blocks
can be allocated and owned by a context. There can be multiple
contexts in Sonilo.
A cache is associated with a particular
context (referenced via a number known as a resource id).
---
The render thread of Sonilo can free a context by sending
a message containing the resource id to the memory manager.
The memory manager looks up this cache, clears the cache,
and frees the cache itself.
---
The set of blocks can be represented in a 1024-bit number,
which is half a block. Each bit represents a block id.
---
The other half of a block may be used for a block mapping
list. I don't think I want to articulate all of what this
is yet, but it's a list that maps local block id values to
renderer block id values to copy over. But, I'm still thinking
about that. It could also be a quick stack for convenient
block re-use. For now, it's just free space.
---
Working on the bitset.

I generated some min heaps. Not sure if they are actually min
heaps. Will need to visualize them (draw them out?). I might
actually give a crack at drawing then and then making the arrays

#! dz csmet/cs248/news
These chapters are taking more time than I expected. There's
just not enough hours in the day. I've been putting sections
on the calendar, which has been a helpful way to pace out
my reading material over the days and weeks. I can probably
do 2 sections a day tops.
---
By my counting, there are 62 sections left. Average time
feels like it's pushing a little over an hour, let's say
1.3 hours. So that's 80.6 hours. Optimistically, we're
doing on average 2 hours of reading a day. That's 40.3
hours. That's 5.7 weeks if we're consistent about it.
---
I need a way to flexibly distribute workloads over a period
of time. We have "tasks". tasks have dependencies. Tasks
can have weights. We have some number of days, and a certain
bandwidth. Avoid dates, because dates are hard. Deadlines
are measured as day offsets of "now".
---
I'll need to allocate some time for this, as reading
isn't going to go away. This task manager load balancer
app is going to have to wait. Manual google calendar
adjustments it is.
---
Huh. Well this is an interesting surprise. I filled out
the readings in my calendar. It's a perfect fit. In theory.
It will suck until November 13th. Chapter 8 is the largest
chapter, and that's when I have it marked down to be finished.
From there, things thin out to a section a day. So,
maybe I do have a chance of reading this whole thing?

@12:21 planning study schedule #timelog:00:07:39
#! dz csmet/cy100
I goofed, and I forgot that I was going to do unit 3 this
week. This has to get bumped a few weeks due to midterms.
I also didn't schedule the sections. I had no notifications,
so nothing came in.
---
The remaining ones only have 3 units each intead of 4. That
makes atomic planning smaller, but maybe they'll each
take longer to do.

@12:34 Sonilo Planning #sonilo #timelog:00:24:14
I gotta put something in the calendar for these, otherwise
I'll never do it.
---
I would like to have interactive sound by new years eve.
That means monome, REPL, realtime audio. Not necessarily
live coding maybe? Hotswapping can wait until the new year
if it's needed (and at this current pace, it might be
needed).
---
So: Monome, REPL (Konilo integration?), real-time audio.
Currently, we are working on memory structure and allocation
mechanisms. After that's done, I can move on to other things.
---
I'm putting a Sonilo DSP proof of concept for beginning
of november. Finish implementing memory allocation, get it
to allocate some memory for a phasor to read, and write
some blocks to disk. If I can figure that much out in the
next few weeks, cool.
---
November will be mostly Konilo integration. That means researching
how to get Konilo to talk to Sonilo. Proof of concept: make
a patch that can write blocks to disk. Maybe at this point
have some more compelling DSP.
---
December will be IO. Initial Monome IO and realtime audio IO.
This might not be glued together in time. But perhaps I
can make meaningful segments. Eventually, the monome will
be an input source into Konilo as an interface to manipulate
musical data (sequences, patches, etc) for the sonilo interface.
Just getting it woring in Konilo could be good enough. Meanwhile,
hearing Sonilo programs in realtime would be cool. Even if
the messaging isn't there yet. Maybe a non-interactive
listener would be cool.
---
There's a tradeoff here. If I want interactive end-to-end
that means building temporary things that are flimsy and
may be over-utilized. This is how most creative projects
tend to go. Meanwhile, if I go slow and patiently and try
to do it all right, it's possible I may just lose the energy
required to keep doing this, or it might simply never be
good enough to ever be finished.
---
More thining required. But at least I got some stuff on
the calendar.

I indulged a little bit, and created a TODO item for
all the "code" tasks I made. 58 tasks. That means if we
timebox things to 5 minutes each task, that's 232 minutes,
which is a little under 4 hours for full coverage. 3 hours
gives us 75 percent coverage. If I can rally another hour
today, 1.5-2 hours tomorrow, I'll feel good. I will use
a hard timer and tokens.

I found a discrete math textbook, and already I can tell
it's a much better textbook for this stuff. It's open source,
it's approved by some math associated, and it has solutions.
I can download it as a PDF and read it from my remarkable.
---
So, here's what I'm going to do. For everything that is
covered in the zybooks, I'm going to find alternative sources.
---
I think this discrete math textbook I found by Oscar Levin
covers enough that I'll have some things to chew on.
Definitely for the rest of the semester (plus the bare minimum
for this class).

This ended up being quite the ordeal. I tried working through
the slide code. I didn't like their implementation, didn't
care to copy it, and ended up just using the implementation
out of CLRS.

@09:46 buddy system implementation #sonilo #timelog:01:32:56

It needs to be fleshed out more, but I want real data to
work with for this task graphing utility I am going
to build for scheduling tasks and generating daily agendas.

I ended up building the high-level "artist purpose" knowledge
graph I started building yesterday, which outline
artistic purpose. The actual tasks have yet to be made.

Also used this time to clean up the task graph. I now
have top level task in Sonilo that just reads "make meaningful

@20:30 There's a topological sort unix utility?!
This whole time. This whole damn time. It's just been here.
It turns out that this does many of the bits I need for
this task manager I'm trying to whip up. So, this saves
some time. Why do it in Rust, when a few awk and shell
scripts can do the trick.
---
anyways. I made some bugfixes to the traverse utilty,
and added some tools to make it work with tsort to generate
a topologically sorted list.

@21:22 Using tsort to tweak the initial ordering
More explicit edges needed for the ordering to make
logical sense. It's nice to figure that out now and not
2 weeks from now.

@09:39 cropping and tagging #archiving #timelog:00:15:06

@10:06 Try to get task distribution to work in AWK #timelog:01:04:38
I've managed to create a set of tasks and sort them. Now,
I need to schedule them. I think I can do a proof of
concept in Awk to bootstrap the initial data.
---
got some initial data being generated. I think I need
to write a program that can load this data and process it.

@11:13 initial scaffolding for an ed-like command language in rust #timelog:00:17:27

@13:51 more work on the command language, added agenda #timelog:02:24:05

might even be usable?
