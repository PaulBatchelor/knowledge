@2025-02-10 New logs, early morning
I'm at the hub now. Trying to figure out a better
log structure that can work on the order of years.
Right now, I'm going to see what it's like grouping logs
by month.

@09:39 settling in.

@09:50 trying out ed with my logs
so far, it is a little clumsy

@09:55 1-bit png support #timelog:00:51:10
#! dz dagzet/dzb/tasks/initial_work
we have this already, just need to retrofit it for
the codebase.

@10:47 break

@11:28 uf2 support #timelog:00:28:24
#! dz $
adapt from mnolth code, create example

@12:03 checksum for buffer, use in testing #timelog:00:26:26
#! dz $

@12:25 checksum test for fonts
#! dz $

@13:52 time to load in initial dagzet data, starting with keytree #timelog:01:31:10
#! dz dagzet/dzb/tasks/initial_dz_data

@13:59 path lookup table 
#! dz $

@17:44 Employed

@18:47 more path lookup table work. #timelog:00:34:15
#! dz $

@19:26 wow that was too much debugging
#! dz $

@19:36 right, now to load in key data. #timelog:00:27:18
#! dz $

@20:08 finally, a file loader for keys #timelog:00:29:48
#! dz $

@20:24 oops, there are two number fields not one
#! dz $

@2025-02-11 Ridgewood, maybe hub

@10:25 get the size parameter into key tree #timelog:00:16:47
#! dz dagzet/dzb/tasks/initial_dz_data

@10:52 intial scaffolding for loading JSON object #timelog:00:23:24
#! dz dagzet/dzb/tasks/initial_dz_data

@10:53 bringing in cJSON
@! dz $

@10:58 working on a loader function
@! dz $
I mainly need to do this to extract the JSON, I just
don't remember the schema

@11:40 importing some older knowledge graphs

@15:33 more object loading work #timelog:00:38:12
@! dz $

@18:04 object loading continued: nodes #timelog:00:15:00
@! dz $
