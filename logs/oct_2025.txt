some getting used to. Hopefully I will be less slow at it.

Problem 1: write a function called isMinHeap that
checks if the input array is a minHeap.
---
Problem 2: least common ancestor BST. This is a leetcode
problem that I can never get quite right. Make sure to
identify the edge cases.
---
Most of the work for both of these I imagine will be
coming up with examples to test. I vaguely remember Knuth
talking about the challenges of coming up with good
examples for trees in textbooks, though I may be misremembering.

I think I have a block list working finally. I initially
had this tricky where I would use memory offsets to calculate
block value and I was going to save some space by packing
2 nodes to a word, but then I realize I lose the elegance
of the packing scheme. So, we're back to each node being
a word, with 16 bits being wasted on empty data (for now),
and the block number being computed as an offset from the
linked list.

@09:38 logging in. planning.
@09:48 I need to start scheduling in times to work on sonilo #sonilo #timelog:00:25:15
If I don't, it's going to slip through my fingers.
---
I've become pretty reliant on a calendar (of the Google variety
currently) to distribute my academic workload. Why stop
there?
---
This sounds very very much against the spirit of "passionate work".
But, if I only worked music when I felt like it, I'd never
get anything done.
---
Thoughts for today: I would like to bring Sonilo to NY. What
do I want to have done by then? I leave on the 24th.
