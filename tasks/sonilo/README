A few words to myself on what I am doing here.

This is a prototype for a project management system.
The idea is to create a set of tasks in order, and then
distribute them over a set of days.

Run "samu" to generate all the data. It will do the
following:

Generate tasks.txt: this is a script that generates an
topologically sorted list of tasks, which are nodes in
the knowledge graph. See "sonilo.sh".

Generate schedule.txt: once the task list has been generated
"tasks.txt", the schedule is made. This creates a list
of pairs (colon-delimited) indicating the task, and the
relative day to start the task. The number of days is
hard coded a the moment in "distribute.sh".
