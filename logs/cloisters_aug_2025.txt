@09:50 ASIDE: Thinking about Gesture Morphemes #gesture
Once again, thinking abou the gesture synchronization
problem. Spent some time notating morpheme sequences,
and gestures that react to morpheme signals. Made some
timeline diagrams to try to show the various timing issues.
It is indeed a concurrency problem.
