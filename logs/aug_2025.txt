@2025-08-18 First Day Unemployed (yet again)
It's been about 4 months since I last did anything
at all related to this knowledge graph. Job consumed my life,
and what was left I put into trying to make life work
in New York. I've quit my job, quit new york, and am now
gearing up to pursue a CS degree in Boston.

@10:56 Setting up Coursera Algorithms knowledge graph #timelog:00:32:32
#! dz coursera/algos1/news
Remembering how to use my knowledge graph.
---
I find myself wanting to build out the curriculum as
a tree. This is something I've done before. Start with
the provided structure (table of contents, course curriculumn,
etc), and build emergent structures through connections.
---
Organizing myself. Going to get some slides downloaded,
placed in a folder somewhere (not in this graph).
---
Hmmm, when I'm taking notes, I'm going to want to be
able to make nodes on the fly. Flow needs to be append-only.
I like logging here too.
---
It's hard to make connections beyond something you heard
only a few minutes ago. Tying things to very big established
concepts could work. an emergent tagging system could
also be interesting.
---
Maybe there's just something called "stream" which is just
raw stream of conciousness append-only nodes that I take
during lectures. Later, I would go back and edit the nodes?

Observations: brute force, empirical analysis, an^b,
log log plots, straight line, linear regression.
---
The review problem at the end had a table of values and
their time, and they wanted you to pick which equation
was the closest match. I worked it out by plugging
in the number for each one, but the better way to have
done it would have been to do it algorithmically. The
model can be represented as $T(N) = aN^b$. It can be
observed that b is 2, and a can be solved algebraically.

I just botched the analysis problem at the end of this
last video. The last answer was literally my last guess.
Which leads me to think, I really don't know how to analyze
programs and have no intuition for it currently.

I do not understand the question at the end, how these
equations are all O(n^3).
---
Follow-up: It's a semantics thing. It's an upper bound, but
it doesn't have to be the tightest upper bound. f(x) = 1
can be O(n^3) even though it is O(1).

3-sum in quadratic time, search in bitonic array, egg drop.
---
3-sum: for some reason I misremembered the problem and thought
the inputs were triplets, but that doesn't make any sense?
The memorized answer I have is "sort the array, then turn it
into a 2sum problem with 2-pointer". But, it would be nice
to explain how that is O(n^2) time.

@17:42 Working through union find again #timelog:00:22:24

I want to populate the knowledge graph. Gonna try ed again.

@09:55 more union find knowledge graph-ing #timelog:01:15:42
#! dz coursera/algos1/modules/02_union_find
I'm going through growing pains with ed. It's very limiting
not seeing the whole document. I just created a node,
and accidentally added it to another tree.
---
The web browser view can be a little clumsy sometimes.
---
I need a way to navigate the knowledge graph like a directory,
and also perform searches. FUSE is almost a little too
tempting.
---
Anyways. back to dynamic connectivity.
---
I'm running into an impedence mismatch with how I'm trying
to structure information (hierarchy, graphs), input system
(ed, largely append-only lines and commands with only
nearby context), and how the information is presented.
---
My workflow seems to work like this: knowledge is a hierarchy.
Presentation always starts with a "big" concept, then
smaller concepts that lead up to the "big" concept. Then
those smaller concepts get broken down into smaller concepts,
so on, so forth.
---
This union find submodule has a few sections. Right now,
I'm looking at "quick find", which has a data structure,
and find/union operations for dynamic connectivity.
---
Good enough stopping point. Still figuring out the best
workflow for knowledge graphing.

@13:25 weighted quick-union: weights are based on total number of items, not height?
#! dz $/improvements/weighted
I'm trying to grok the code, but my first assumption was that
the weighted quick-union measured weights by tree "height",
since that's a common enough performance metric. It looks
like this just measures the total number of objects.

@15:19 working out a nodels command #timelog:00:40:23
Given a namespace, list out nodes. do not include children
of subgraphs.

good enough

oops not good enough. wanted to list top-level namespaces

too much too mind today trying to reduce friction for the
mind map.

Okay, I think that's good enough for now.
