@2025-08-18 First Day Unemployed (yet again)
It's been about 4 months since I last did anything
at all related to this knowledge graph. Job consumed my life,
and what was left I put into trying to make life work
in New York. I've quit my job, quit new york, and am now
gearing up to pursue a CS degree in Boston.

Remembering how to use my knowledge graph.
---
I find myself wanting to build out the curriculum as
a tree. This is something I've done before. Start with
the provided structure (table of contents, course curriculumn,
etc), and build emergent structures through connections.
---
Organizing myself. Going to get some slides downloaded,
placed in a folder somewhere (not in this graph).
---
Hmmm, when I'm taking notes, I'm going to want to be
able to make nodes on the fly. Flow needs to be append-only.
I like logging here too.
---
It's hard to make connections beyond something you heard
only a few minutes ago. Tying things to very big established
concepts could work. an emergent tagging system could
also be interesting.
---
Maybe there's just something called "stream" which is just
raw stream of conciousness append-only nodes that I take
during lectures. Later, I would go back and edit the nodes?

Observations: brute force, empirical analysis, an^b,
log log plots, straight line, linear regression.

The review problem at the end had a table of values and
their time, and they wanted you to pick which equation
was the closest match. I worked it out by plugging
in the number for each one, but the better way to have
done it would have been to do it algorithmically. The
model can be represented as $T(N) = aN^b$. It can be
observed that b is 2, and a can be solved algebraically.
