I did not finish this one
---
It looks like I forgot to copy over the values themselves,
which may be why I was getting the error.
---
I was appending the wrong thing to the queue. I should
have been the neighbor, not the newneighbor.

I remember something weird was tripping me up with this
one. Might have been the thing that converts strings
to numbers? Or possibly the division?
---
This is basically a stack problem.
---
I got tripped up again. divide towards zero means
int(a/b), not a // b.
