nn glossary/binary_relation
ln Binary Relation: a way of expressing a relationship
ln between two sets. A binary relation between two sets
ln A and B is a subet R of AxB.

ln Graph Power Theorem: let G be a directed graph.
ln let u and v be any two vertices in G. THere is an edge
ln from u to v in G^k if and only if there is a walk of
ln length k from u to v in G.
ff What is the Graph Power theorem?
fb For any k >=1, there is an edge(u,v) in G^k if and only
fb if ther eis a walk from u to v of length k in G.
