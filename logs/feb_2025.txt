@2025-02-10 New logs, early morning
I'm at the hub now. Trying to figure out a better
log structure that can work on the order of years.
Right now, I'm going to see what it's like grouping logs
by month.

@09:39 settling in.

@09:50 trying out ed with my logs
so far, it is a little clumsy

@09:55 1-bit png support #timelog:00:51:10
#! dz dagzet/dzb/tasks/initial_work
we have this already, just need to retrofit it for
the codebase.

@10:47 break

@11:28 uf2 support #timelog:00:28:24
#! dz $
adapt from mnolth code, create example

@12:03 checksum for buffer, use in testing #timelog:00:26:26
#! dz $

@12:25 checksum test for fonts
#! dz $

@13:52 time to load in initial dagzet data, starting with keytree #timelog:01:31:10
#! dz $

@13:59 winding up a generic hash table
#! dz $
