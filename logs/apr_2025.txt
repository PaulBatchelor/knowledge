@20:41 Create partially automated rust docs extractor #timelog:00:45:00
Added in playground/go/htmlparse. Incomplete. I think
I have all the raw ingredients, what is left is to generate
properly formatted dagzet code.

@09:59 Rust Scraper/card generator work #timelog:00:45:32
It works. I still need to do a little bit
of manual formatting with a downloaded rust page, but
I think it will save me some time.
---
Manual work involves: curling the page to an HTML page,
running "tidy" to make it easier to edit, and then
extracting just the section to be converted to cards,
which are just a pile of div/li elements. Then, this file
can be passed into the program and the resulting DZ file
gets printed to stdout.

@10:51 try out the new tool #timelog:01:07:50
Okay, it broke. the HTML formatting is different on Pin
and process. Let's see how hard it is to get this working.

working now, getting some automation tools set up

@21:41 Leetcode flashcards #leetcode-flashcards #timelog:00:29:31
I'd like to revisit these bits of my knowledge graph,
and attempt to turn as much as I can into flashcards.
