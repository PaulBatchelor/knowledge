@2025-09-04 Settling into Newton. First day of classes
I arrived in Newton last Saturday, and have been setting
things up for the long haul. I finally have enough of a
workstation to get started.

@08:24 settling in, setting up knowledge
Today is my first day at my desk. Getting this ready
to watch lecture videos. I am behind.

@08:34 now, where was I
#! dz coursera/algos1/news
we are behind on problems. my percolation assignment is
very overdue.
---
For module 3, I watched the video, but I did not take any
notes. Or at least, I didn't seem to transcribe anything
for the knowledge graph.

@08:47 ugh. I need to see my messages. tool mind strikes again
#! dz coursera/algos1/news
Given a node, list the messages associated with that node.
---
Infrastructure pains. How do I get these logs built with
just this knowledge graph. I guess for now we can't. Seems
to build quickly enough.
---
logzet can build all my logs, apparently. That's cool.
Now to figure out how to get the query right.
---
Uh-oh. Entries only have a date, but no time.
---
Got a query readable enough for now. Going to turn this
into a script.
