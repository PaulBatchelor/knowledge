@2025-08-27 My trip the the american museum of natural history
Wow what day.
---
I thought to myself, surely this would be a good day to hop on a
train for an hour to go to the Met Cloisters. Only to discover
literally minutes after stepping off the train that it was closed
on Wednesday.
---
Then I thought to myself, surely this would be a good day to go to
the Met in Manhattan, it's only 45 minutes away. Only to discover
literally minutes after stepping off the train that it was closed
on Wednesday. I should have figured that one out, right?
---
So, I figure, I'm about 5 minutes walking distance from the American
Museum of Natural History. I've never been, always wanted to go. I
don't know when I am going to be back there. So I go. I'm there for
5 hours.

And that's the day.
