@10:36 Working on v2 ed expressions #timelog:02:05:04
I'm thinking this will be a good time investment,
since I've been working with a lot of tree structures.
Being able to express trees in ed would enable me to
write S expressions which could allow scheme code.

Going to try tweaking a few things.

@13:00 rust knowledge graph-ing, with flash cards
The goal right now is to do a breadth-first traversal on
all the items in the rust std docs, then build flashcards
for them.
I'll probably start with the top-level nodes.
@13:09 first migrating to their own dz file #timelog:00:17:09
